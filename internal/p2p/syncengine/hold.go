// Holding back a save that was emptied.
//
// A folder whose every save file went at once — an uninstaller, a game
// resetting its saves, someone clearing the wrong folder — reads to a sync
// as "every file deleted", and a sync passes deletions on: the other devices
// would delete their copies too, and the save would be gone everywhere at
// once. So a game with a save location that is empty here, which held files
// before, is held back: this device starts no sync of it (SyncGame answers
// ErrHeld) and gives no other device its manifest (the serving side answers
// HeldMessage, and the asking side skips it as peer_holding). Nothing is
// deleted anywhere until someone says what was meant, in the app or with
// `opensave emptied`:
//
//   - "Delete them there too" (ConfirmHold): the game syncs as it is; the
//     other devices delete their copies, keeping a snapshot first as they
//     always do.
//   - "Put them back" (PutBack): the newest snapshot with the files is
//     restored here, and anything it lacks is fetched from the other devices.
//     Until every file is here the other devices still see nothing of this
//     one: they judge deletions by their own record of what the two had in
//     common, which nothing here can change, and a folder still missing a
//     file would read to them as that file deleted.
//
// What the location "held before" is the files the other devices are
// recorded as having in common with this one, together with the files in
// this device's newest snapshot that has any — from a snapshot taken since
// the location has had the folder it has now (lastSavedFiles). Not the first
// alone: that
// record lags — a file pushed to another device joins it only once that
// device has said it has the file — while the other device's own record,
// which is what it acts on, already has it. The snapshot is there before the
// deletion happens, so it is also there before any sync can see the empty
// folder, however quickly one comes.
//
// A hold lets go by itself when every file it covers is back — restored from
// the Recycle Bin, say — since nothing would be deleted any more. Not merely
// when the folder has something in it again: a game that wiped its saves and
// started a new one still has a question waiting about the old ones.
//
// Only an empty location counts. A few files deleted at once is how a game
// tidies up after itself; all of them is not.

// HeldMessage is what this device says to a manifest request for a game it
// is holding back. Shared by the serving side (internal/p2p) and isHeld here,
// as AwaitingFolderMessage is, and free of "not found" for the same reason.
